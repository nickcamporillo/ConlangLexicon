All the stuff here under CRS.Repositories is temporary.  The methodology in Dat's model is different,
and most likely the same thing too with Rekha's SSV.  Both use DI, so there's no "new EfContext()"
anywhere in those apps.  So these files are just temporary until the DI can be implemented
using Unity.
